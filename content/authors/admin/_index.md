Hi there ðŸ‘‹! 

Iâ€™m a researcher using mathematics and statistics to explore how our immune systems respond to infection and vaccination.

Iâ€™m based at the [CharitÃ© Centre for Global Health](https://globalhealth.charite.de/), where my work focuses on making sense of serological data and developing better tools for immunological modelling.

If youâ€™re interested in modelling serological data, take a look at [seroanalytics.org](http://seroanalytics.org/) (and the [GitHub](https://github.com/seroanalytics))!

You can also browse my [publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=d74gCRYAAAAJ&hl=en), [research outputs](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Hodgson-19) and [personal Github](https://github.com/dchodge/).
