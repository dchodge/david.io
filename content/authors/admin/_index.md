Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm a researcher who uses mathematics and statistics to better understand immune responses to infection and vaccination. I work in the [CharitÃ© Centre for Global Health](https://globalhealth.charite.de/).

What tools to model serological data? Check out [seroanalytics.org](http://seroanalytics.org/) (or [github](https://github.com/seroanalytics))!

Check out my [publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=d74gCRYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [research outputs](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Hodgson-19).
