Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm a researcher who uses mathematical and statistics to better understand immune responses to infection and vaccination. I work in the [Center of Mathematical modelling of infectious disease](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) (or CMMID).
